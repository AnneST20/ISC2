<strong>
What is a Digital Badge?
</strong>
<p>
A digital badge is a simple way for you to share you credential online. You can attach your badge to a website, email signature, or social network, and with one simple click, employers and other interested parties can easily view and verify your credential and the skills and experience required to earn it.
</p>
<strong>
Why Do You Need a Digital Badge?
</strong>
<p>
<span>Digital badges keep your credentials up-to-date in a web-based world</span>. With digital badges, you never have to make an employer wait while you find your member number, call a phone number, or fill out mandatory fields in an online form; you simply provide them a one-click verification of your certification and skills.

When someone clicks the link corresponding to your ISC2; digital badge, an overview page is presented on the Credly site, and will look like this:

        <p>While badges are simply digital image files, they are uniquely linked to data hosted on the Credly platform. This link to verified data makes them more reliable and secure than a traditional paper-based credential. It also eliminates the possibility of anyone claiming your credential and your associated identity.</p>

    <div class="faq-marker">A:</div><div class="faq-text">
        <p>Absolutely. Every certification and profile on the Credly platform has a unique URL that can be embedded on a resume or website. The platform also offers seamless integration with several popular social and professional networking platforms for the display of certifications as open badges. Sharing to LinkedIn enables the earner to permanently display the achievement within their profile with single click verification. In order to display your badge on your LinkedIn profile, log in to Credly, select the badge you would like displayed on LinkedIn and then select share. The site will then walk you through connecting to LinkedIn and a series of confirmation steps. Please note that when a certification is referenced in a LinkedIn profile, an image of the ISC2; logo is displayed online, not the actual badge image.</p>
