<h1 class="h1 bar">The ISC2 CBK</h1>
<p>A CBK &ndash; sometimes simply called a Body of Knowledge &ndash; refers to a peer-developed compendium of what a competent professional in their respective field must know, including the skills, techniques and practices that are routinely employed.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The (ISC)&sup2; CBK is a collection of topics relevant to cybersecurity professionals around the world. It establishes a common framework of information security terms and principles which enables cybersecurity and IT/ICT professionals worldwide to discuss, debate and resolve matters pertaining to the profession with a common understanding, taxonomy and lexicon.</p>
<p>(ISC)&sup2; was established, in part, to aggregate, standardize and maintain the (ISC)&sup2; CBK for security professionals worldwide. Domains from the (ISC)&sup2; credentials are drawn from various topics within the (ISC)&sup2; CBK, which are used to assess a candidate's level of mastery of the most critical aspects  of information security.</p>
<p>The (ISC)&sup2; CBK is updated  by the (ISC)&sup2; CBK Committee to reflect the most current and relevant topics required to practice the profession.</p>
