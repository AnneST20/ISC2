<p>These terms and conditions of sale (these &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) as well as those found on the Class Agreement (together, the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) are the only terms which govern the sale of ISC2 Classroom-Based, Online Instructor-Led, and Online Self-Paced training services (individually referred to as a &ldquo;Class&rdquo; or collectively the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;) and the physical and digital Class materials (the &ldquo;Products&rdquo;) by International Information System Security Certification Consortium, Inc. (&ldquo;ISC2&rdquo;) to the buyer named on the Class Agreement (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a written contract signed by both parties is in existence covering the sale of the Services covered hereby, the terms and conditions of said contract shall prevail to the extent they are inconsistent with these Terms. Signing the Class Agreement serves as agreement &ldquo;as is&rdquo; to these terms and conditions.  </p>
<p><strong>Payment Terms:</strong><br>
  The following payment terms are required along with a signed Class Agreement.  </p>
<p><strong>Full Payment:</strong> FULL PREPAYMENT BY CREDIT CARD, CHECK, OR BANK WIRE TRANSFER.</p>
<p><strong>Credit:</strong> CREDIT WILL BE ACCEPTED IN PLACE OF FULL PREPAYMENT WITH AN APPROVED CREDIT APPLICATION.  CREDIT REVIEW AND PURCHASE ORDER REVIEW TAKE FIVE BUSINESS DAYS EACH FOR APPROVAL. TERMS FOR CREDIT CAN CHANGE AT ANY MOMENT BASED ON COMPANY&rsquo;S CREDIT RATING AND PAYMENT WITH ISC2.    </p>
<p><strong>Federal &amp; State Agencies:</strong> A PURCHASE ORDER WILL BE ACCEPTED IN PLACE OF FULL PAYMENT.</p>
<p>The process for invoices is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Invoice will be created upon signed Class Agreement.   <br>
  2. Invoice due within agreed-upon terms (see Payment Terms above)<br>
  3. All orders are non-refundable. <br>
  4. Unless agreed otherwise, Classes are not confirmed/Products will not be delivered until full payment is received by ISC2.</p>
<p>We ask for any processes related to online invoicing be provided prior to ordering to avoid delays. If Company chooses to use a third party to process its order, ISC2 is not responsible for any additional fees that the third party might charge. Please send credit applications and purchase orders directly to the ISC2 account manager working on Company&rsquo;s account.</p>
<p><strong>Order Processing and Days for Fulfillment:</strong><br>
  <strong>Physical Products</strong>: ISC2 will ship physical Products to the location listed in the Class Agreement. Unless expressly agreed to by the parties, ISC2 shall deliver the physical Products to the location listed in the Class Agreement, using ISC2&rsquo;s or its vendor&rsquo;s standard methods for packaging and shipping of the Products. Delivery will be made FOB Warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Products</strong>: Digital Products will be released to the e-mails provided to ISC2. </p>

</tr>
</tbody></table></div>

	   
<p>Any time quoted for delivery is an estimate only; provided, however that ISC2 shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver all Products on or before the requested delivery date. ISC2 is not liable for or in respect of any loss or damage arising from any delay in filling an order, failure to deliver, or delay in delivery. No delay in the shipment or delivery of any Product relieves Company of its obligations under this Agreement, including accepting delivery of any remaining installment or other orders of Products. Risk of loss and title to Products shipped under any Class Agreement passes to Company upon ISC2&rsquo;s delivery of such Products to the carrier at its warehouse. </p>
<p><strong>Class Cancellation Fee:</strong><br>
  For Classroom-Based and Online Instructor-Led training, Company may cancel without cause upon written notice to ISC2 at any time prior to the start of the Class upon payment of an amount based on the following price:</p>

	<div class="table-wrapper" style="margin-bottom: 3em;"><table class="table"><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Up to 30 calendar days prior to the first day of Class</td>

<tr>
<td>Less than 30 calendar days prior to the first day of Class</td>
<td>100% of Class Agreement amount</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table></div>
	
<p><strong>Student Eligibility:</strong><br>
  Attendance at ISC2 Classes are limited to employees of Company.  Without prior written consent, resale of an ISC2 Class to the general public is strictly prohibited and will be cause for immediate termination of the Class without refund to Company.</p>
<p><strong>Last-Minute Substitutions:</strong><br>
  For Classroom-Based and Online Instructor-Led training, if an emergency prevents the designated instructor from teaching the Class, ISC2 reserves the right to substitute a qualified replacement.  If a suitable replacement cannot be found, ISC2 reserves the right, with Company &rsquo;s consent, to postpone the Class.  If postponement is not convenient for Company , ISC2 may cancel the Class, in which case all payments made by Company will be refunded.  </p>
<p>If an emergency prevents a student from attending a Class before the Class begins, Company may designate a substitute.  If an emergency causes a student to miss one or more days of a multi-day class, ISC2 discourages attendance by substitutes, since subsequent days of instruction assume exposure and understanding to preceding material.  Each separate person who receives online Products will be treated as an enrolled student, and Company agrees to pay additional fees, if any, due to ISC2 for additional enrollees.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright and Proprietary Rights License: </strong><br>
  Company acknowledges that ISC2 owns all rights, title and interest in and to all Products, all of which are protected by copyright laws and shall not be shared, copied, recorded or reproduced by Company by any means for any purpose. ISC2 grants Company&rsquo;s students a limited license to use the Products in furtherance of the Services contemplated herein and for no other purpose. </p>
<p><strong>Commitment to Quality:</strong><br>
  ISC2 commits that it has the requisite resources, skill, experience and qualifications to perform the Services under this Agreement in a professional and workmanlike manner, in accordance with commercially reasonable industry standards for similar services. To provide the highest quality and consistent classroom experience, we ask our companies to follow through with the following items:</p>
<p>1. Do not provide any special add-on materials, sessions, special giveaways, or other offers as part of the Class which may modify the Products or Class requirements provided by ISC2 without the prior written approval of ISC2;<br>
  2. Ensure Class times begin as advertised; and <br>
  3. Supply accurate information on the Class Agreement. If ISC2 has reasons to believe that inaccurate information provided on the Class Agreement will affect the outcome of the Class, ISC2 reserves the right to withhold shipment of Products without penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Classroom-Based Training Requirements</strong><br>
  For Classroom-Based Training, Company shall provide suitable space, furniture, support equipment, Internet access, and other items necessary for conducting the Class. For more information about recommended Class equipment, please contact the ISC2 Account Manager working on Company&rsquo;s account. </p>
