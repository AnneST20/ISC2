<h2>ISC2; Certification Verification</h2>
<p>As an organization that certifies individuals in information security, ISC2; is frequently requested to verify whether an individual's assertion that they possess our certification is accurate. It is an implied duty that ISC2; identify and attest to the certified status of those individuals who do possess our certification. As such, ISC2 will verify whether an individual is certified by ISC2; or not upon receiving sufficient identifying information regarding the subject of the inquiry. ISC2; also provides a verification process on its public website which lists members based on last name. This listing provides the name, city/state/country, and certification title held by the member. However, under no circumstances is any contact or other information disclosed.</p>
