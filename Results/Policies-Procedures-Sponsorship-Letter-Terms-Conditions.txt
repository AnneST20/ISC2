  <em>Revised 12-14-2022</em><p></p>


<p>These terms and conditions of sale (these &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) as well as those found on the Sponsorship Agreement (together, the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) are the only terms which govern the sale of a sponsorship of an ISC2 event or webinar (the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;) by International Information System Security Certification Consortium, Inc. (&ldquo;ISC2&rdquo;) to the buyer named on the Sponsorship Agreement (&ldquo;Sponsor&rdquo;) (collectively, the &ldquo;Parties&rdquo;, and each, a &ldquo;Party&rdquo;). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a written contract signed by both Parties is in existence covering the sale of the Services covered hereby, the terms and conditions of said contract shall prevail to the extent they are inconsistent with these Terms. Signing the Sponsorship Agreement serves as agreement &ldquo;as is&rdquo; to these terms and conditions.  </p>
<p><strong>Payment Terms:</strong><br>
The following payment terms are required along with a signed Sponsorship Agreement.  </p>
<p><strong>Full Payment:</strong> FULL PREPAYMENT BY CREDIT CARD, CHECK, OR BANK WIRE TRANSFER.</p>
<p><strong>Credit:</strong> CREDIT WILL BE ACCEPTED IN PLACE OF FULL PREPAYMENT WITH AN APPROVED CREDIT APPLICATION.  CREDIT REVIEW AND PURCHASE ORDER REVIEW TAKE FIVE BUSINESS DAYS EACH FOR APPROVAL. TERMS FOR CREDIT CAN CHANGE AT ANY MOMENT BASED ON SPONSOR&rsquo;S CREDIT RATING AND PAYMENT WITH ISC2.    </p>
<p><strong>Federal &amp; State Agencies:</strong> A PURCHASE ORDER WILL BE ACCEPTED IN PLACE OF PREPAYMENT.</p>
<p>The process for invoices is as follows:</p>


<p>1. Invoice will be created upon receipt mutually executed Sponsorship Agreement.   <br>
2. Invoice due within agreed-upon terms (see Payment Terms in the Sponsorship Agreement). <br>
3. All sponsorships are non-refundable and may not be cancelled. <br>
4. Unless agreed otherwise, sponsorships are not confirmed until full payment is received by ISC2. Sponsors who have not paid as of the date specified in the Sponsorship Agreement may forfeit sponsorship opportunities.</p>


	
<p>We ask for any processes related to online invoicing be provided prior to ordering to avoid delays. If Sponsor chooses to use a third party to process its order, ISC2 is not responsible for any additional fees that the third party might charge. Please send credit applications and purchase orders directly to the ISC2 account manager working on Sponsor&rsquo;s account.</p>


<p><strong>Copyright and Proprietary Rights License: </strong><br>

<p><strong>Waiver</strong><br>
No waiver by ISC2 of any of the provisions of this Agreement is effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by ISC2. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement operates, or may be construed, as a waiver thereof.

The provisions of this Agreement are severable. In the event any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by any act of Congress or act of any legislature or by any regulation duly promulgated by the United States or a state acting in accordance with the law, or declared null and void by any court of competent jurisdiction, then any such part shall be reformed, if possible, to conform to the law and, in any event, the remaining parts of this Agreement shall be fully effective and operative insofar as reasonably possible. If not, such provision shall be severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision contained in this Agreement and shall continue to be binding upon the Parties hereto.</p>

Neither the termination nor expiration of this Agreement relieves either Party from its obligations to pay the other any sums accrued hereunder. The Parties agree that their respective rights, obligations, and duties as well as any rights, obligations, and duties that, by their nature, extend beyond the termination or expiration of this Agreement survive any termination or expiration and remain in effect thereafter.</p>
