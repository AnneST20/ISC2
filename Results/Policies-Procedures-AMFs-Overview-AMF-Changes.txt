<h2><strong>New AMF Rates and Policy Changes Effective July 1, 2019</strong></h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>To continue investing in enriching, valuable resources that enable our members and associates to grow as professionals, the ISC2; Board of Directors approved updates to our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isc2.org/Policies-Procedures/Member-Policies">membership policies</a>&nbsp;and an increase in our Annual Maintenance Fees (AMFs).</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>New AMF Schedule</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; We are no longer billing at the end of your membership year. Members and associates are now required to pay their AMF <span style="text-decoration: underline;">up front</span> upon the anniversary date of their certification or associate designation.&nbsp;To remain in Good Standing, all members were required to ensure their accounts aligned with the new payment policy by June 30, 2019. This included paying all outstanding AMFs for 2019, 2018 and any earlier years still unpaid. Members and associates who failed to comply with the new policy have been suspended.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>New AMF of U.S. $125</strong>&nbsp;<strong>or U.S. $50</strong> Â­&ndash; Our AMF is U.S. $125 for certified members and U.S. $50 for Associates of ISC2;. </p>
<p><strong>Savings for Multiple Certifications</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Members with multiple certifications save as they only pay a single AMF of U.S. $125 regardless of how many ISC2; certifications they earn. If you hold multiple certifications, your single AMF of U.S. $125 is due on your earliest certification anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>For New Members and Associates</strong> &ndash; Candidates who pass their exams and whose endorsements have been approved for ISC2; certification must pay their first AMF of U.S. $125 before certification is granted. Candidates who pass their exams and are applying for associate designation must first pay their first year&rsquo;s AMF of U.S. $50 before their associate designation is granted. Once a certified member or an Associate of ISC2;, AMFs will be due each year on the anniversary date of their certification or associate status being awarded.</p>
<p><strong>Updated Member Policies&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; To clarify policies and procedures for members, we have revised the ISC2; Certification and Member Maintenance Policy, and ISC2; Reinstatement Policy. All policies are available online&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isc2.org/policies-procedures/member-policies">here</a>.</p>
