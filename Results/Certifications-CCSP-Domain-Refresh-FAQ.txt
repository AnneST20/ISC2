        <p>(ISC)&sup2; has an obligation to its membership to maintain the relevancy of its credentials. These enhancements are the result of a rigorous, methodical process that (ISC)&sup2; follows to routinely update its credential exams. This process ensures that the examinations and subsequent continuing professional education requirements encompass the topic areas relevant to the roles and responsibilities of today's practicing cloud security professional.</p>

        <p>The content of the <a href="https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Certifications/Domain-Refresh/CCSP-Domain-Refresh.ashx" target="_blank">CCSP has been refreshed</a> to reflect the most pertinent issues that cloud security professionals currently face, along with the best practices for mitigating those issues. Some topics have been updated while others have been realigned. The result is an exam that most accurately reflects the deep knowledge and hands-on experience with cloud security architecture, design, operations and service orchestration.</p>
<p>As a result of the content refresh, we have updated two of the domain weights:</p>
