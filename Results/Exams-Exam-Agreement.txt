    </li>
    <li><strong>ISC2; Code of Ethics</strong>
        <p><strong>5.1</strong> All cybersecurity professionals who are certified by ISC2; recognize that such certification is a privilege that must be both earned and maintained. In support of this principle, ISC2; members are required to commit to fully support this Code of Ethics (the "Code"). ISC2; members who intentionally or knowingly violate any provision of the Code will be subject to action by a peer review panel, which may result in the revocation of certification. There are only four mandatory canons in the code. By necessity, such high-level guidance is not intended to be a substitute for the ethical judgment of the professional. Additional guidance is provided for each of the canons. While this guidance may be considered by the board of directors in judging behavior, it is advisory rather than mandatory. It is intended to help professionals identify and resolve the inevitable ethical dilemmas that they will confront during the course of their cybersecurity career. More can be learned at <a href="/ethics">https://www.isc2.org/Ethics</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>5.2</strong> Code of Ethics Preamble:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Safety of the commonwealth, duty to our principals, and to each other requires that we adhere, and be seen to adhere, to the highest ethical standards of behavior.</li>
            <li>Therefore, strict adherence to this Code is a condition of certification.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>5.3</strong> Code of Ethics Canons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Protect society, the commonwealth, and the infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally.</li>
            <li>Provide diligent and competent service to principals.</li>

    <li><strong>Governing Law</strong><br>
Any claims, controversies, issues, or cause of action arising out of or related to this Agreement, the examination, certification, or any other part of the Program (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;) shall be finally resolved by arbitration in accordance with the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution Rules for No Administered Arbitration by a sole arbitrator, who shall be qualified as an attorney at law with experience relevant to the dispute. The arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1 et seq., and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator is not empowered to award damages in excess of compensatory damages, except in cases involving breach of non- disclosure or intellectual property, and each party expressly waives and foregoes any right to punitive, exemplary or similar damages unless a statute requires or permits that compensatory damages be increased in a specified manner. Arbitration shall proceed solely on an individual basis without the right for any Claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving Claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of others. The arbitrator's authority to resolve and make written awards is limited to Claims between you and ISC2; alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless agreed to in writing by all parties. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.<br>
    <br>
Notwithstanding the foregoing, both parties may file and prosecute an action for injunctive or similar equitable relief and the filing of such an action shall not constitute a waiver of the parties’ rights to require arbitration of any other dispute. Violation of any of these provisions may cause irreparable harm to ISC2 for which monetary remedies may be inadequate, and ISC2 may take all appropriate actions to remedy or prevent such disclosure or misuse, including, without limitation, obtaining an immediate injunction without being required to post bond. This Agreement shall be governed and construed and enforced in accordance with the substantive and procedural laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, U.S. except for its choice of law rules. Unless waived by ISC2 in its sole discretion, any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be instituted in a state or federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, U.S.. The parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, these courts in any such legal action or proceeding. The parties agree to accept service by U.S. certified mail or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by other legally available method.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Assignability.</strong> Neither this Agreement nor any right granted hereunder shall be assignable or otherwise transferable by you.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Waiver and Severability.</strong> The waiver by either party of any default or breach of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach. In the event any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the other provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement, including the ISC2; Inc. NDA, supersedes all prior agreements, commitments or representations between the parties, whether oral or written, as well as any downloaded or translated version of the Agreement. ISC2; reserves the right to amend this Agreement with notice to its members. Notice may be posted to the member-only website or sent to each member&rsquo;s email address of record.</li>
