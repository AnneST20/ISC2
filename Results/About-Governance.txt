<p align="center"><strong>Member Corporate Records Request Policy</strong></p>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong><br>
  The purpose of this policy is to describe how ISC2 members may request access to certain corporate records.  </p>
<p>Members have inspection rights to the following documents:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Articles of organization, </li>
  <li>Bylaws, </li>
  <li>Minutes of member meetings and </li>
  <li>Stock and transfer records (not applicable to ISC2)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also a right for the general public to view the last three years of IRS (Internal Revenue Service) Form 990s. No statutory right exists for members to view other records including director meeting minutes, corporate records and policies. </p>
<p>However, members may have a limited right to certain records. This right is not absolute, and only applies to members who are acting in good faith and for the purposes of advancing the corporation&rsquo;s interest and protecting their rights. This right also applies to specific rights given to members within the company's organizational documents. </p>
<p>Under the current ISC2 bylaws, members have a right to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Vote for directors, </li>
  <li>Add agenda items to the Annual Meeting or a Special Meeting, </li>
  <li>Approve mergers, </li>
  <li>Dispose of substantially all the assets, and</li>
  <li>Amend the bylaws and articles of organization. </li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, to the extent any records may relate to those duties, members may have a right to such records if such a request is for a proper purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Policies </strong><br>
  The following policies are already available to members: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/Policies-Procedures/Member-Policies">Member Policies </a> </li>
  <li><a href="/Policies-Procedures">General Corporate Policies </a> </li>
  <li><a href="/About/Governance">Board of Directors Policies</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Other policies and corporate records must be requested.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Process to Request Policies or Corporate Records</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>All requests for ISC2 policies or corporate documents should be sent to <a href="mailto:legal@isc2.org">legal@isc2.org</a>.</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>All requests should be clear enough to enable ISC2 employees to conduct a meaningful search. </li>
  </ol>
  <li>ISC2 employees may ask questions about the substance and purpose of the request to respond fully and in a timely manner. </li>
  <li>ISC2 will review the records requested and determine if they are among those mentioned in this policy, or records that ISC2 is legally required to make available. If the records are not among those mentioned in this policy, or records that ISC2 is legally required to make available, ISC2 will determine if the purpose is proper for the request to be granted. </li>
 <ol type="a">
    <li>A proper purpose is defined as someone acting for an honest purpose, not adverse to the interest of the corporation. </li>
    <li>The right cannot be exercised for mere curiosity, or for merely speculative purposes, or vexatiously.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>If the purpose is proper, as defined herein, ISC2 will determine if any information needs to be redacted, or if the information should be viewed in person and not delivered electronically. ISC2 also may require any requestor to execute an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) should it determine it is needed. ISC2 will then proceed to Step 6. </li>
  <li>If the purpose is not proper, ISC2 will respond to the individual letting them know the request is denied. </li>
  <li>Once the appropriate redactions are made, ISC2 may deliver the records in the format agreed.</li>
</ol>
	
<p>At all times, ISC2 is under no obligation to reveal information that may be covered under attorney-client confidentiality or other work product, materials collected for purposes of litigation. </p>
