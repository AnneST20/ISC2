<h2>One Year Prerequisite Pathway</h2>
Candidates may satisfy the one year work experience requirement if they earn a degree from an accredited college or university or regionally equivalent education program. For purposes of certification, (ISC)&sup2; looks for the following characteristics of an approved cybersecurity degree:<br>
<br>
<p>1) &nbsp;The degree originates from a cybersecurity program which addresses cyber, information, software and infrastructure security topics within its requirements;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>2) &nbsp; Is one of the following preapproved degree programs:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Computer Science</li>
    <li>Computer Engineering</li>
    <li>Computer Systems Engineering</li>
    <li>Management Information Systems (MIS)</li>
    <li>Information Technology [IT]</li>
</ul>
<p>The list of preapproved degree programs will be updated periodically.</p>
<p><strong><em>Verification of Work and Education Experience</em></strong></p>
<p>Activities that do not relate to the domains of the (ISC)&sup2; SSCP CBK cannot be included in the reported number of years of experience. If non-qualifying activities are included, that experience will be deducted.
