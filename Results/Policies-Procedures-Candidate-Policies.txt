  4.3 Upgrade to ISC2 Certified Member Status</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3.1 In order for ISC2 Candidates to achieve ISC2 certified membership status, they must successfully pass an exam and submit the corresponding endorsement application for their certification of choice. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3.2  Upon approval of the endorsement application, the Candidate will receive an email confirmation outlining the next steps toward certification. This will include paying an upgrade fee of $75, assuming that the $50 candidate annual due was already paid for that year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3.2a  If a Candidate has successfully passed the Certified in Cybersecurity (CC): The AMF for CC certification is $50 annually. Assuming that the ISC2 Candidate has already paid their annual dues for that year, there will be no upgrade fee associated with upgrading from Candidate status to CC-certified because the annual dues paid for that year already covers the AMF associated with the CC certification.</p>

	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3.4  The ISC2 Candidate status will be terminated under the termination reason &lsquo;Upgrade Candidate.&rsquo; A three-year certification cycle will start once upgrade payment is received. The ISC2 Candidate badge will be terminated, and a new credential badge will be issued.
